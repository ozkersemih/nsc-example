## Description
This repo is about to show examples to use
[eslint-plugin-nest-swagger-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-nest-swagger-checker-lint/v/1.0.7)  plugin and [nest-swagger-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nest-swagger-checker) package in your NestJS projects.

To test `nest-swagger-checker` package you can run `nest-swagger-checker`command in your terminal. 
Some endpoint and parameters in this project doesn't have description etc to show how this package works.

In the same way, eslint plugin also installed and it works as default.

Also you can see a file in the root director: `.swautomaterc`
It is configuration file, you can set `true` , `false` or `null` and see behaviour of eslint plugin and package.

Normally you don't need to install both package together. I installed both of them for example. 

If you change anything in config file please restart eslint server in your ide to work eslint plugin correctly.
